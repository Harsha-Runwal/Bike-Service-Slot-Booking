<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>A system that allows bike user to book vehicle servicing slot online sometime before the actual servicing because sometimes due to some reason he cannot reach service centre on time and most of the service centres takes service request for a stipulated period of time on a particular day. An authenticated user will select nearest service station from his location and station rating. And will be timely notified by email notification regarding service updates. There will be provision to pay some charges as a booking charges.
   The dynamic slot management feature of the system allows service station to update daily order request slots based on resources availability. Regarding operations, some servicing plans (combo of operations compiled together) will be provided to user to select while slot booking. Also there will be provision to add some specific operations while booking. On this basis system will generate bill. Service station will be provided with some features like business statistics, order history having data to manage and improve stationâ€™s work efficiency. An admin will check authenticity of service station.
